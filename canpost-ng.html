<p>The User Can Post code (<tt class="docutils literal">gs.group.member.canpost</tt>) decides if a group
member can post. In this document I present a proposed new structure
for the User Can Post code. I begin by outlining the <a class="reference internal" href="#rules">rules</a> that have
to be implemented, and then summarise how the existing system works
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#old-system">old system</a> below). I then present my proposed <a class="reference internal" href="#new-system">new system</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="rules">
<h1>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules</h1>
<p>[Taken from the README in <tt class="docutils literal">gs.group.member.canpost</tt>.]</p>
<p>A person can post if one of two sets of rules are met. One rule is for <a class="reference internal" href="#unclosed-groups">unclosed groups</a>, the other is for <a class="reference internal" href="#closed-groups">closed groups</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="unclosed-groups">
<h2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unclosed Groups</h2>
<p>The first rule is that the someone can post if he or he is not blocked
from posting and the group is <em>unclosed</em>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Blocked from posting</dt>
<dd>A member is blocked from posting if he or she has been added to the
<tt class="docutils literal">blocked_members</tt> list.</dd>
<dt>Email Blacklist</dt>
<dd>Posting from a particular email address is banned if the address is
listed in the <tt class="docutils literal">email_blacklist</tt> table.</dd>
<dt>The group is unclosed</dt>
<dd>Support groups allow anyone who is not blocked to post, even if the
person posting does not have a profile. Due to the Teutonic heritage
of GroupServer, such groups are known as <tt class="docutils literal">unclosed</tt>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="closed-groups">
<h2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed Groups</h2>
<p>The second rule is that a person can post if all of the following
conditions are met. This is the most common check, because most groups
are closed.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Blocked from posting</dt>
<dd>A member is blocked from posting if he or she has been added to the
<tt class="docutils literal">blocked_members</tt> list.</dd>
<dt>Email Blacklist</dt>
<dd>Posting from a particular email address is banned if the address is
listed in the <tt class="docutils literal">email_blacklist</tt> table.</dd>
<dt>The group is closed</dt>
<dd>Most groups are closed: only members can post.</dd>
<dt><em>Not</em> anonymous</dt>
<dd>Only people with profiles can post to closed groups.</dd>
<dt>Group member</dt>
<dd>The person posting must be a member of the group in order to post.</dd>
<dt>Has preferred email addresses</dt>
<dd>To post to a group the member must have at least one verified email
address. This rule exists to prevent people from partially creating
a profile and then posting to a group.</dd>
<dt>The maximum posting rate has <em>not</em> been hit</dt>
<dd>GroupServer can limit the rate that members can post. This prevents
trite and trivial messages (&quot;me too!&quot;) from being posted. The
posting rate only applies to normal members: participation coaches
and administrators are not subject to the posting rate.</dd>
<dt>Member has the required properties</dt>
<dd>All required profile properties must be provided before a member can
post. There are two types of required properties: those that are
required by the site, and those that are required for the group.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="old-system">
<h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old System</h1>
<p>The old system implemented a monolithic whole. The <tt class="docutils literal">GSGroupMemberPostingInfo</tt> class both checks to see if the group member can post, and provides a status message if the group member cannot post. The core check is carried out by a giant Boolean statement:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
not(self.user_blocked_from_posting()) and\
    (self.group_is_unclosed() or\
        ((not(self.user_anonymous()) and\
            self.user_is_member() and\
            self.user_has_preferred_email_addresses() and\
            self.user_is_posting_member() and\
            not(self.user_posting_limit_hit()) and\
            self.user_has_required_properties())))
</pre>
<p>The statement is made up of two parts — one for the unclosed group,
and one for the closed group — separated with an <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt>. Within
each the two parts a series of rules are written, separated by some
<tt class="docutils literal">and</tt> expressions.</p>
<p>The rules themselves are methods of the <tt class="docutils literal">GSGroupMemberPostingInfo</tt>
class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-system">
<h1>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New System</h1>
<p>I propose creating a system that made use of <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.zope.org/zope.component/README.html#adapters">adapters</a>. The
adapter would take a group and a group member, just like the current
<tt class="docutils literal">GSGroupMemberPostingInfo</tt> class. However, different types of groups
would have different adapter. This would allow different rules for</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Support groups, which are <tt class="docutils literal">unclosed</tt>,</li>
<li>Standard discussion groups, which are <tt class="docutils literal">closed</tt>, and</li>
<li>Announcement groups (see <a class="reference external" href="http://projects.iopen.net/groupserver/ticket/613">Ticket 613</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These adapters would provide an interface that is similar to the
existing code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class IGSPostingUser(Interface):
    canPost = Bool(title=u'Can Post',
      description=u'Can the user post the the group?',
      required=True)

    statusNum = Int(title=u'Status Number',
      description=u'The reason the user cannot post to the group, '\
        u'as a number. 0 if the user can post.',
      required=True)

    status = Text(title=u'Status',
      description=u'The reason the user cannot post to the group, '\
        u'as a textual description.',)
</pre>
<p>Internally the rules would be implemented by a series of other
adapters. They would be acquired by a query for some named adapters
that support a particular interface. This will allow the code to be
shared between the three main adapters. For example, the check for a
blocked email address should be done at site-level, and carried out by
all groups. Another shared block of code could be for a <em>closed group</em>
(see <a class="reference external" href="http://projects.iopen.net/groupserver/ticket/449">Ticket 449</a>).</p>
<p>The adapters that implement the rules will have to be sortable. In
this respect they are similar to the viewlets that make up the tabs
on the group pages. (The Can Post adapters would be similar to the
viewlet managers). The adapter must also be able to generate a string,
describing the reason that the person was blocked.</p>
